# Snek!

You are Snek. You're small and always hungry. Your appetite is endless and so are your enemies: armies of mindless ants, voracious skittering centipedes, poo-bombing birds, and hidden spider traps. Your only hope is to get bigger and faster than everything else, evading until you can face them head on and clear your habitat. You can learn to dash, counter attack, and hide, all of which are unlocked as you gain in your length. Everything is swallowable, yes that includes things like rocks, bottlecaps, bird poo, Snek's own skin: experience is gained and your body is lengthened. Find the mottled egg and care for it, or eat it! All in all, things go in the front and out the back, anything and everything. You are Snek!<br>
