# Snek!

You are Snek. You're small and always hungry. Your appetite is endless but so are your enemies: armies of ants, deadly centipedes, birds, and wolf spiders. Your only hope is to get bigger and faster than everything around you, evading until you can face them head on. Snek can learn to hide, dash, and counter attack as power is gained aka **length**. Everything is swallowable, yes that includes things like rocks, bottlecaps, bird poo, Snek's own skin, . Use everything to your advantage. Find the mottled egg and care for it, or eat it! All in all, things go in the front and out the back, anything and everything. You are Snek!<br>
