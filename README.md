# Snek!

You are snek. You're small and always hungry. Your appetite is endless but so are your enemies: armies of ants, deadly centipedes, birds, and wolf spiders. Your only hope is to get bigger and faster than everything around you, running from the biggers until you can face them head on. Snek can learn to hide, dash, and counter attack as he gains in his *length*. Everything is swallowable, yes that includes non-nutritious things like rocks, sand, bottlecaps, and bird poo. Use everything to your advantage. You are snek. (when night comes, things change... to be continued)
